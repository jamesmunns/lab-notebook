![part image](https://ae01.alicdn.com/kf/H28f2b22f238b4229b18e656790e74999W.jpg)

I have ordered a pair of HUB75 panels [from AliExpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32955158941.html).

These use a different protocol to the WS2812B or other smart-leds, and I haven't figured out how I will drive them yet.
