I currently have a couple of flexible WS2812b panels [ordered from Aliexpress](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/33018595434.html). They come in the following configurations:

* 8x8 pixels, 80x80mm
* 16x16 pixels, 16x16mm
* 8x32 pixels, 80x320mm

I plan to use these as a programmable load when testing the [LiPo Stamp](./../../projects/lipo-stamp.md).
