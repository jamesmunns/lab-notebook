# Anachro

Anachro is an umbrella projects that consists of two main things:

* A flexible and lightweight communication protocol designed to work over a variety of transports (e.g. wireless, UART, RS-485, SPI)
* A microcontroller based PC architecture

See the [Anachro Docs](https://anachro.computer) and the [Anachro Repo](https://github.com/jamesmunns/anachro) for more details.

You can also watch a talk I gave about Anachro at RustLab 2020.
