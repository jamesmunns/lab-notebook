# Embedded - The Missing Parts

"Embedded - The Missing Parts" is a work-in-progress book that aims to track all of the concepts I believe are important in "real world" embedded engineering projects, but are not necessarily taught as part of a university education, or could be easy to miss when self-taught.

It started as a [Twitter Thread], and is tracked online at <https://emp.jamesmunns.com>. The project uses [mdBook], which also powers this lab notebook. It spawned from a [table of contents] written with other engineers from the embedded industry.
