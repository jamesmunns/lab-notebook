# Home Fleet

> TODO: More details here

Home fleet is my project to build a home sensor network entirely from scratch.

See the [Home Fleet Repo](https://github.com/jamesmunns/home-fleet) for more information.

Home fleet uses the [Anachro Protocol] over the [ESB wireless protocol].

[Anachro Protocol]: ./anachro.md
[ESB wireless protocol]: https://crates.io/crates/esb
