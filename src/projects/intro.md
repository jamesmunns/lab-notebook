# Projects

These are projects of mine that I am working on or have worked on. They may be software based, hardware based, or a combination of both.

Personal projects are rarely "done", but they occasionally reach new levels of usefulness.

Unless otherwise specified, any software for these projects is written in Rust.

This section serves as a combination of "showcase" and "current status", depending on the state of the project.

All items in this section are either "work in progress" or "complete for now". For project ideas that are still in the concept phase, see the [Ideas Section](./../ideas/intro.md).
