> TODO: Picture of my keyboard with caps and a case

I am building a mechanical keyboard, based on the [makerdiary m60]. This PCB is based on an nRF52840 m.2 SOM. It is a 60% keyboard, e.g. no numpad, arrow pad, PgUp, PgDn, etc.

Right now the code for this only exists [as part of the Anachro project](https://github.com/jamesmunns/anachro/tree/main/stargazer/key-003), and only outputs using the Anachro protocol. USB and BT support has not been written.

## Parts

* [Logic Board][makerdiary m60]
* [Clear 60 key case](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32701421088.html)
* [Aluminum Stablilizer plate](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/32658373834.html)
* [Key Dampers](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Qty-135-Pieces-Rubber-O-Ring-Dampers-dampener-keycap-Key-Switches-Mechanical-Keyboard-CHERRY-MX/32706070464.html)
* [Gateron Red Switches](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B07X3SYQMV)
* [PBT Keycaps](https://www.amazon.de/-/en/gp/product/B083W146YG)

## Usage

I intend to use this in multiple ways:

* As a USB-C keyboard for my PC
* As a Bluetooth keyboard for my PC or Tablet
* As a wired keyboard for Anachro-PC
    * This will use the debugging header on the PCB
