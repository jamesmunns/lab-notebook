# Anachro Bus Routing plan

I want some kind of "message board table" based on received/sent message types

For routing, you always echo messages from one bus to the other.

Everyone just sends to "everyone" (for now?)
If you are a dom, you periodically transmit frames on your turn
If you're a sub, schedule in downstream incoming frames
either: send out a dedupe message every 15-30s

When joining a network:
* Send dedupe code (maybe also make this the announce message?)
    * This triggers other device to start sending message?
* Wait for N seconds to see if an echo occurs

Dedupe message is just 4 bytes of unique id, 4 bytes random number. If you hear the message come back, disregard that channel for 30-60 seconds, set some warning code (yellow light)?

## Device discovery?

Avoiding fixed device ids?

Maybe:

In the future: maybe have some kind of crypto here? Probably not wanted/needed here **yet**.

### Overall summary

* Have a "broadcast" window, something like 1ms
    * Dom sends out random u32 and largest available ID range
    * Anyone not on the bus must jitter between 100us-900us
    * Then send their IDu8, plus (ID as u32 muladd random)
    * "READY" state achieved!
    * If not ready, wait for next round
    * Send ACK for any success number
* For each READY number, next
    * Send new random number challenge
    * Respond (jittered) with response
    * If multiple good responses for one number, NAK number
    * "SET" state achieved!
* For each SET number, next
    * Send new random number challenge
    * respond EXACTLY 10us (or something)
    * "ACTIVE" state achieved
    * Send "active ack"

### Dom

* Spend 999ms doing normal stuff
* Top of every second:

### Sub

Mostly the opposite as above, but also:

* If in the READY/STEADY/ACTIVE/CONNECTED state, don't respond to all call
* If >= 3 seconds from last ACK without moving forward (except in connected), reset to IDLE
* MAYBE don't bid on every all-call? 1/2? 1/4? 1/8?

### Broadcast/response - `broadcast_initial`

Dom sends

```text
# broadcast initial
[ random_number: u32 ][ min_wait_us: u32 ][ max_wait_us: u32 ][ min_id: u32 ][ max_id: u32 ]
```

After `rng.gen_range(min_wait_us..=max_wait_us)` us, Sub sends back:

```text
# broadcast ack
[ own_id: u32 ][ own_id_checksum: u32 ]
```

where:

* `own_id`: `rng.gen_range(min_id..=max_id)`
* `own_id_checksum`: `own_id.wrapping_mul(random_number).wrapping_add(random_number)`

If successful, Dom sends:

```text
# broadcast ackack
[ own_id: u32 ][ SUCCESS_MAGIC_WORD: u32 ]
```

#### Then twice: - `broadcast_ping`

Dom sends

```text
# broadcast confirm
[ random_number: u32 ][ min_wait_us: u32 ][ max_wait_us: u32 ][ id: u32 ]
```

where `id` should == `own_id`
and `random_number` is a TOTALLY NEW random number

TODO: Maybe just make this a `dest` field, with the initial broadcast being `0` or something

After `rng.gen_range(min_wait_us..=max_wait_us)` us, Sub sends back:

```text
# broadcast ack
[ own_id: u32 ][ own_id_checksum: u32 ]
```

where:

* `own_id`: `rng.gen_range(min_id..=max_id)`
* `own_id_checksum`: `own_id.wrapping_mul(random_number).wrapping_add(random_number)`

If successful, Dom sends:

```text
# broadcast ackack
[ own_id: u32 ][ SUCCESS_MAGIC_WORD: u32 ]
```

# Routing thoughts

Okay, so above I described "everyone broadcasts everwhere", but I think I need to decide what kind of stuff I need.

I think I have two main choices:

1. Keep the bus everywhere idea
    * All devices would basically just look for specific message IDs on the bus
    * All devices would have to listen and decode (or at least filter packed ID) continuously
    * This probably wouldn't work great with Anachro, which is more point-to-point
    * This wouldn't require any kind of "coordinator" role
2. Do real routing, focus on (sender, receiver) pairs
    * Easiest way: Expect a DAG, with the arbitrator "rooted" at the terminal node
        * Have "send up" and "send down" primatives
            * They push an addr on each level
                * moving up push on sub -> dom
                * moving down push on dom -> sub
                * What about sub/sub devices?
            * When we hit the terminal node, the message stops propigating

## Prop routing

* dom only (head)
* sub only (bus OR tail)
* dom/sub (head + bus)
* sub/sub (tail + bus)
* dom/dom (head + head, not possible yet)


### Example network 1

* Device A - dom only
    * Device B (id: 1) - sub only (bus)
    * Device C (id: 2) - sub only (bus)
    * Device D (id: 3) - dom/sub (bus)
        * Device F (id: 1) - sub only (bus)
        * Device G (id: 2) - sub only (bus)
        * Device H (id: 3) - sub (tail)
    * Device E (id: 4) - sub only (tail)

Examples:

Device A would be prompted (how?) to send a "Send down" message:

* to B: [1]
    * Terminates here
* to C: [2]
    * Terminates here
* to D: [3]
    * To F: [3, 1]
        * Terminates here
    * To G: [3, 2]
        * Terminates here
    * To H: [3, 3]
        * Terminates here
* to E: [4]
    * Terminates here

Foreach terminator, respond with the end message. Responses:

* [1, $anachro_id]
* [2, $anachro_id]
* [3, 1, $anachro_id]
* [3, 2, $anachro_id]
* [3, 3, $anachro_id]
* [4, $anachro_id]

I guess what I really want is to be able to include a unique ID in the response, like the anachro uuid. I guess it's my bus, why not?

OH, but I guess I don't need a GLOBAL routing table, just:

* Which way is the anachro arbitrator
* Which anachro devices are on which sub nodes

Can I use this to handle the sub/sub tail case?

* Rooted node starts
    * Subs log onto the bus
    * If a Sub is also a dom:
        * Start domming

The process for "joining" the anachro message bus is:

* If we're a power-dom (anachro arbitrator), just start domming immediately
* Otherwise, wait for one of the ports to become active


### Profiles

* power-dom: anachro router + 1x dom port
* switch: anachro device + 1x dom port + 1x sub port

### Pains in the ass

* What if a tail is also a sub on a bus?
    * This is annoying, because they are a dom on neither interface
    * This requires subs to ALSO have a routing table, I guess
