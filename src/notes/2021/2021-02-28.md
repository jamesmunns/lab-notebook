# Board Design Weekend - 000

Introduction

* Design a simple board
* Design a board with no SMT parts
* STM32F4x1 "Black Pill"
* Lego Mounts
* PMOD-eque pinouts
* Maybe a fancy 12 pin connector idea I have
* Maybe some QWIIC connectors
* Maybe a fancy debugger connector

## Post scratch Layout notes

* STM32F4 Black Pill
* Ethernet Connector (as debugger)
* 5xPMOD headers
    * 1x SPI
    * 1x I2C
    * 1x UART
    * 2x GPIO
    * NOTE: ALL PMODs repeated 3x
* 1x12 pin "Everything" connector
* 2x 1x6 Mounting Holes
* QWIIC connectors (common to I2C PMOD)
    * Probably on the bottom
    * 1: GND
    * 2: VCC
    * 3: SDA
    * 4: SCL
