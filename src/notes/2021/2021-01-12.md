# Idea for message serialization

`keev` - a Key-Value Serialization format with a concept of optionality on each side.

tl;dr:

* All messages exist in a "top level" namespace
* There is no versioning of messages. New message, new number.
* Protocol speakers should expect to "negotiate" which versions they CAN speak, and which they will use.
    * Input/Output capabilities?
    * This should probably only happen once, on connection
* For anachro: Remove the concept of paths
* Use an enum, make it non-exhaustive
* Have a method for generating the RX and TX capabilities
