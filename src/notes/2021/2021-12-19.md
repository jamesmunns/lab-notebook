# Plans

* Get USB task up and going, 1khz or so?
    * Interrupt pended?
* Define wire format for USB
* Get a desktop + USB anachro client working
* Get to the point where I can subscribe to `*` from the host client
* Start publishing hello world messages in the firmware
* Switch to defmt bbqueue
* In the future, I might not want the USB connection to actually be a server/dom? What about connecting to USB devices that AREN'T the dom? Does that make sense?
    * Let's just build it and see what I actually need
