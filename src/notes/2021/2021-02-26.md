# Adafruit EInk Display

## SRAM Chip

Microchip 23K640

8KB/64Kb SRAM - Max Clock 20 MHz

## EInk

Control chip seems to be part of the display assembly?

Resolution is 212 x 104

Guessing from the Adafruit code, the controller is either an IL0373 (["Z16" variant](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_EPD/blob/master/src/panels/ThinkInk_213_Tricolor_Z16.h)) or SSD1686 (["RW" variant](https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit_EPD/blob/master/src/panels/ThinkInk_213_Tricolor_RW.h)).

Connector reads "WFT0213CZ16LW"

Seems to match Waveshare's similar hat product:

EPD waveshare [doesn't seem to support](https://docs.rs/epd-waveshare/0.4.0/epd_waveshare/) 2.13" displays

Waveshare code seems to be here:

This folder has a couple potential matches?

<https://github.com/waveshare/e-Paper/tree/master/STM32/STM32-F103ZET6/User/e-Paper>

This one looks like it PROBABLY is enough: <https://github.com/waveshare/e-Paper/blob/master/STM32/STM32-F103ZET6/User/e-Paper/EPD_2in13bc.c>

Ah! It looks like the "Z16" variant has the matching resolution (212x104), while "RW" is probably the more recent display which has a higher resolution (250x122).

Oh. This one is even called the "RW Panel with SSD1680": <https://www.adafruit.com/product/4814>

And the original one says "Driver chip is the IL0373". I should practice my reading skills.
