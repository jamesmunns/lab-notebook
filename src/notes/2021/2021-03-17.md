# bbqueue based defmt sink

* I need an atomic mutex container, to hold the Producer
* Used framed messages
* Way to recover messages in case of failure?
    * RAM buffer to drain to from watchdog interrupt?
    * Sort of application specific...
    * Any way to "recover" bbqueue state?
        * Probably not, stored in BSS...
