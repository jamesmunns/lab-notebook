So, I guess the sequence for `III` would be:

1. A is woken up by the PC link
2. It checks its Cap port. It gets some kind of response on the bus
3. It checks its Bus port. It gets no response. That port now becomes idle (maybe checking again later)
4. A begins enumerating devices on the bus. At some point, it now knows about B, G, and L.
5. Once B, G, and L are awake, they each check their OTHER port. They each find:
6. B enumerates C, D, E, and F - so B is a sub on it's bus, and a dom on its cap. C, D, E, and F are all only subs (because they find no devices on their other ports
7. G enumerates H and I - so G is a sub on its bus, and a dom on its cap. H and I are only subs (same as above)
8. L enumerates J, K, M, O, P, and Q - so it is a sub on the cap, and a dom on the bus
9. J, K, M, O, P, and Q go through the same dance
10. J, K, O, P, and Q are subs-only
11. M enumerates N, so M is a sub on the bus, and a dom on the cap
12. N checks, finds nothing, sub only, process complete

Since the PC could potentially "see" (or be notified) of all of these changes, I guess the PC itself could determine the DAG, or the shortest path, even in the case of a loop, and just command-back the routing path necessary to return to the PC.

I don't really need or want the bus to be totally self standing (famous last words)
