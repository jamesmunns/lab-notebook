# Bootloader

* Pick an address (for now)
    * In the future, I should probably store this somewhere that can be re-flashed

## Settings Page

* I2C address?
    * App
    * Bootloader
* Listen to pin(s) for bootload?
* Listen to pin(s) for I2C addr?
* Checksum

Do I want a separate command for changing settings? Or just allow it like any other subpage write?

Do sanity checks on settings?

## Procedure

1. Bootloader boots
    * Disable all interrupts
2. Is button held?
    * Y: GOTO 5
    * N: Continue
3. Is bootload RAM flag set + magic word valid?
    * Y: GOTO 5
    * N: Continue
4. Boot app at 0x0000_0000
5. Bootload.
    * LED blink?
6. Listen to I2C
    * Write transactions:
        * 0x40 - Start bootload
            * 4 bytes - total checksum (later crc32)
            * 1 byte - total subpages to write
                * NOTE: must be less than 23 * 8 for now
        * 0x41 - write page command
            * Must have set 0x40 already
            * Always 1 + 1 + 256 + 4 bytes
                * 1: 0x41
                * 1: Page/Subpage
                    * 0bPPPPP_SSS (32 pages, 8 sub-pages)
                    * 0bPPPPP must be <= 23
                * 256: subpage contents
                * 4 byte: For now: 32-bit checksum. Later, CRC32 or Poly1305?
            * On writes to subpage zero: erase page
            * Stretch write ack until checksum + erase + write?
                * I can't use the flash while erasing (or writing?) anyway
            * On writes to 0:0: make sure the reset vector is 0x0800_C000
                * Make sure MSP is maxval?
                * 0:0 must be the last thing written
        * 0x42 - reboot to new image
        * 0x43 - abort bootload
            * No data
        * 0x44 - Offer image downstream
            * Only after finishing 0x40 transaction
    * Read transactions
        * wr-then-rd 0x10 + 16 bytes => b'sprocket boot!!!'
        * wr-then-rd 0x11 + 4 bytes => maj.min.triv.reserved
        * wr-then-rd [0x21, P:S] + 260 bytes => Read subpage
        * wr-then-rd 0x22 + 1 byte => status
        * wr-then-rd 0x23 + 4 bytes => children flashed


### Status

Represent:

* Is bootload (of me): idle, active, complete, error (2-bit)
* Does my app look reasonable? yes/no (1-bit)
* Is bootload (of chain): invalid, idle, active (next), active (downstream), complete


### TODO: On (critical?) error?

* Finish current transaction
* Disable I2C (auto-naks)
* reboot
* Probably not for checksum errors, unless a lot

## Compile time to-do for bootloader

* Change memory range
* Disable interrupts
* Ensure Reset is at base of flash (add linker assert?)
