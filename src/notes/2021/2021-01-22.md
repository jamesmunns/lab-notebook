# Slim Key Switches

These are footprints for the keyswitches for the MNT reform.

And the switches themselves:

But what would I want an external keyboard to do?

It would be sort of nice to have a standalone device that I can run a python-ish style calculator app on, but that would require a significant number of keys.

Maybe something that can do some basic functionality as a standalone device, but when plugged in, could be some kind of macro hotkey style device?

Should I just prototype this with the blackberry featherwing?

## Brainstorm use cases

* Timer
* Calculator
* Alarm Clock

## What keys would I use for a python calculator?

* Parenthesis
* Operators
* Period
* Equals
* Letters (for variables - T9?)
* Comment (#)
* Arrows


What if:

Keys: 15x15mm

Note: Xiaomi Mi Mix 2 Dimensions: 151.8x75.5mm

4x6 keypad: 90.0x60.0mm
w/ 5mm space: 120x80mm

```
+   -   *   /
7   8   9   (
4   5   6   )
1   2   3   #
=   0   .   FUNC
LET ARR SPC ENT
```

Do a prototype with a break-away fifth column?
