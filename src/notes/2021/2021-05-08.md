# Intro to Embedded Course Material

> Note: This is an unofficial draft. Content may change, and the course has not yet been offered.

16x 60-90m video lectures, Q&A section at end, take-home assignments based on material from lectures.

Potentially additional office hours.

## Stage One - Circuits

* 01 - Introducing the parts + Concepts
    * Microcontroller
    * USB Helper device (second MCU?)
    * Switches, LEDs, Resistors, etc.
    * Any other external components
* 02 - voltage and current
    * Using a multimeter
    * Ohms Law
    * Passive components
* 03 - Reading a circuit diagram and common components
    * Building circuits on a bread board
* 04 - Active Devices
    * Transistors
    * Regulators
    * Digital Components

## Stage Two - Microcontroller

* 05 - Writing Code, Flashing, Logging, Debugging
* 06 - GPIOs and Timers
* 07 - Peripherals, and Memory Mapped Registers
* 08 - ADCs + PWM
