# Async thoughts

Are these good async demos?

* An async button or two, that do something like cycle colors or turn off the LEDs
* an async SPI driver that handles sending the WS2812 commands
* An async i2c port listening for color/brightness/mode values for 2 LEDs


## I2C port

* Event driven: We are responding to incoming commands
    * Have a couple different API items:
        * Mode (off, solid, blink, updown)
        * Brightness
        * Color
    * Have two register sets
    * Could benefit from interrupts
* Outputs...?
    * Event stream to another Cassette?
    * Poll API for current state?
    * Pub Sub?

## Button

* Purely event driven
    * Basically this is just the exti interrupt? Or polling I guess?
* Outputs...?
    * Event stream?
    * Poll API?

## SPI

* Really just sequencing outputs
* Could have it's own state for sequencing?
* Could potentially benefit from DMA/interrupts?
* Could potentially allow for multiple concurrent senders?

# Approaches

## Brain Default

* RTIC
* EXTI interrupt task
* SPI task
    * Mostly for DMA reload?
* I2C task
    * emit changes/updates?
* IDLE task
    * Doing periodic updates

## ???

* EXTI future
    * allows for waiting on events like transitions?
    * async task that awaits on futures, and sends messages to N channels?
* SPI/smartled task
    * Listens for messages to send (but how does it know to wake up?)
    * Calls future enabled SPI driver
    * Has some sort of "current status" interface?
* I2C Peripheral
    * pretty much all in the interrupt?
