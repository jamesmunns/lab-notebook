# Lego Shopping

So, I want to use Legos as a physical design medium as described in [my prior note](./2021-01-11.md).

## Adafruit Feather mounting board

I think as a test run, I'm going to make a demo for mounting an Adafruit Feather. Brainstorming:

* Have THT holes for the edge pins
* Have mounting holes for the main corner mounts
* Have an optional pair of SMT QWIIC connectors at the front and back
* Maybe break out some other pins too?
* Maybe make a "side mount" and a "top/bottom" mount

## Lego parts shopping

I want some base plates and parts to use for basic mounting (and maybe a little for playing with).

Here's my notes on shopping. These are all amazon.de links, because I'm in Germany.

## Other resources

I had these two online stores recommended to me, which look like a good choice if I want specific parts/colors. Not sure on the cost of shipping or anything.

* https://www.brickowl.com/
* https://www.bricklink.com
* https://ebay.de
    * There seem to be a lot of people selling batches here
    * The going price seems to be about 20-25EUR/kg, which claims ca. 700 pieces

## JLC Tolerances
