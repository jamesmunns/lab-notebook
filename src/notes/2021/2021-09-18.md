# Thoughts on PowerBus Rev 2

* Have a shunt resistor + op amp for measuring 5v usage
* Have some buttons on-board
* Include the stm32g 8x booster board? Optionally?

## Uarte

Take a timer and a uarte and two gpios

Basic RX state machine:

1. Idle, but pended
    * If TX pending: goto 6
    * Else: goto 2
2. Prep Idle RX
    * Disable timer
    * Set GPIOs
    * Clear "Receiving" flag
    * Clear "Flush" flag
    * Enable RXDRDY Interrupt
    * Enable STOP interrupt
    * Start receiving with some max size
3. On First Byte
    * Verify+clear RXDRDY event
    * Disable RXDRDY interrupt
    * Set "Receiving" flag
    * Enable RXDRDY -> Timer Clear shortcut
    * Start timer
4. On Timeout
    * Disable timer
    * Set "Flush" flag
    * Trigger STOPRX event
5. On Stop
    * Check+clear end_rx
    * trigger FLUSHRX
    * Wait for Endrx
    * clear end_rx
    * goto 1
6. Start TX
7. On completion: goto 1
