## Dumb Terminal for Smart Devices

Rough idea: Some kind of simple USB device that talks to "smart devices" and provides a basic USB/Serial interface that exposes data in some kind of table format.

But, problems:

* No one has standard schemas
* Doesn't solve this problem
* Even if we have a schema, everyone does the BT thing
    * "data over serial/proprietary protocol"
