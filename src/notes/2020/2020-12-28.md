# Podcasting notes

I need to set up a couple things:

* Recording
    * Currently done with Zoom, audio quality isn't great
    * I might want to switch to something else with higher quality audio
* Leveling
    * Currently using Auphonic, I like it
* Editing
    * I'll probably use Audacity
* Theme Music
    * I'll probably use Louie Zong - Polaroid
* Album Art
    * ...?
* Hosting
    * I'll use Digital Ocean Spaces
* RSS Feed
    * I'll probably just host on my website
    * https://castfeedvalidator.com/ for validation
