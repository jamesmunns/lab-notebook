# Notes

This section contains unsorted chronological notes. These might include research items that will be used to fill in concepts in the more topic-ordered sections.

This section is strongly inspired by [whitequark](twitter.com/whitequark)'s [Lab Notebook](https://lab.whitequark.org/).

All notes are in an RFC8601 compatible date specification, e.g. `YYYY-MM-DD.md`, and may include a topic, e.g. `YYYY-MM-DD-topic.md`.
