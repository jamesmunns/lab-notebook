## Transcript

I'm James, and this is the Chats with James Podcast.

This podcast started at the end of 2020, when I decided to take a two month leave of absence from my job in order to recharge from a stressful year and to avoid burning out.

Despite being on a break, I still love talking to people, and hearing the kinds of things they're excited about. Whether they're technical experts, beginners to the field, excited about sports, food, or coffee, I get excited by other people's passion.

The first of these chats occurred during the two months between December 2020 and February 2021. I'm not sure yet whether the podcast will continue to record new episodes past that date, but I'm glad to be able to share the wonderful chats I was lucky to have with a bunch of incredible people.

I'll be releasing a new chat every Tuesday, so be sure to check back every week for the latest episodes.

If you're interested in being on the show, feel free to schedule a time to chat with me at https://calendly.com/bitshiftmask.

Thanks, and enjoy Chats with James!
