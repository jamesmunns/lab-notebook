# Robot Face

Idea: Make a dev board that looks like a "robot face". Optionally put it on some kind of Servo arm to give it pitch/roll/yaw, and potentially a neck to rotate or tilt up/down.

## To Be Researched

- Which micro servos should I get?
    - FS-90R not good, continuous
    - Find something quiet AND torque'y?
- 3d layout
    - Probably want to learn a 3d CAD to make sure I have clearance
- How to make brackets?
    - Pre-fab?
    - Acrylic?
    - Cut metal?
